### QA Automation
  
  Motivated by the passion for technology and constant curiosity to seek different solutions to solve problems around me, I got involved in the area of software development. Currently my focus of study and development is the area of Web Development, where I seek to improve my technical knowledge and also improve my skills in Soft Skills. I am interested in innovative projects that add value to people's lives, always valuing communication and collaboration.
